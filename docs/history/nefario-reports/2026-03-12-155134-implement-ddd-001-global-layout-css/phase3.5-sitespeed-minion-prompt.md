You are reviewing a delegation plan before execution begins.
Your role: identify gaps, risks, or concerns from your domain.

## Delegation Plan
Read the full plan from: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T//nefario-scratch-bZH1RI/implement-ddd-001-global-layout-css/phase3-synthesis.md

## Your Review Focus
Core Web Vitals, loading performance, and render-blocking resources:
Task 2 adds tokens.css as a separate <link> in head.html — this is an
additional render-blocking HTTP request on every page load. Evaluate
whether this is acceptable given the EDS performance target (Lighthouse
100, sub-second loads, <100KB per page). Does the split CSS approach
(tokens.css + styles.css) create a meaningful LCP penalty? Should tokens.css
be inlined or concatenated instead? Does the plan maintain the EDS three-phase
loading model (eager/lazy/delayed)? Is the new tokens.css link placed in the
correct loading phase?
