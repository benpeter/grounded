You are reviewing a delegation plan before execution begins.
Your role: identify gaps, risks, or concerns from your domain.

## Delegation Plan
Read the full plan from: /var/folders/3k/bfjvvz9s6dvdn_hvlhvr8lc00000gn/T/nefario-scratch-uCqtZX/ddd-004-home-post-index/phase3-synthesis.md

## Your Review Focus
Security gaps in the proposed design: XSS risks in client-side rendering of query-index.json data, injection vectors in tag/type rendering, any concerns about the HTML structure or CSS approach from a security perspective. This is a design document (DDD), not implementation code — focus on whether the design decisions create security risks that implementation would need to address.
